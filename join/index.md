### Graduate Students

Our lab is currently looking for graduate students from a broad range of scientific disciplines (psychology, neuroscience, computer science, statistics, physics, engineering, mathematics) who are interested in neuroimaging, cognition, and computational modeling.

Our research focuses on understanding the interplay between learning and visual processes in object categorization and causal learning, using a combination of behavioral, computational and brain imaging techniques.

If you are interested in joining our lab, please send a CV to [Fabian Soto](mailto:fasoto@fiu.edu)
.
