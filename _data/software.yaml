  description: A free and open-source toolkit of 3D models and software to study face perception. Includes a database of 27 identity models and 6 emotional expression models, together with software to manipulate the models in ways that are common in the face perception literature (e.g., “morphing”, “anti-faces”, “caricatures”, “averaging”), obtain videos of dynamic faces, standardize irrelevant features in multiple models, and communicate with experiment software (e.g., PsychoPy) to render faces dynamically online.
