## Highlights

{% capture text %}

We study how the neurocomputational mechanisms of visual encoding and learning interact during and face recognition and categorization. We approach this overarching research goal by trying to answer the following questions: How are faces and other objects encoded in the brain? How does learning about faces influence their neural encoding? How does face encoding influence learning and generalization? We take a highly integrative, inter-disciplinary research approach that combines computational modeling, behavioral research, and neuroimaging.
