## Our Philosophy

### Computational: A model-based research approach
We believe that scientific progress is facilitated when we define our questions and hypotheses precisely, through the use of formal mathematical models. Are different aspects of a face (for example, identity and expression) represented independently? Are face parts represented holistically? It depends on what one means by "independently" and "holistically." Formal theories from psychology and neuroscience can provide precise definitions for such ambiguous concepts, and show us the way to experimentally measure them. What are the mechanisms by which depression influences perception of face expressions? What mechanisms underlie the deficit to recognize faces from a different race? We can use models to formalize multiple hypotheses and decide between them. For us, the use of computational models is not a gimmick. We see it as necessary to move the field forward.

### Cognitive: A focus on complex adaptive behavior
Our ultimate goal is to understand complex behavior that helps people adapt to their environment. We believe that this complexity arises from the interaction of multiple, simpler mechanisms of cognitive computation. For example, simple mechanisms that modify face representations (such as gain) can help explaining the influence of category learning on face perception, and the influence of depression in expression perception. Simple mechanisms of learning and representation can explain how people learn to group objects into categories.

### Neuroscience: Brain computation matters
The same observed behavior can be explained through multiple possible cognitive mechanisms (the identifiability problem). How can we decide which one of them is closer to the truth? We believe that when alternative cognitive mechanisms are implemented using principles of neural computation, it becomes easier to tell them apart from both what we already know about the brain (are the mechanisms plausible?) and by collecting new data (do the mechanisms predict well both behavioral and neural data?)

### Face perception: The ideal testbed
In our daily lives, we must constantly process information from faces because of their importance for social interaction. The full range of complexity of our cognitive skills is revealed in face processing, from simply recognizing a friend to trying to figure out what they are thinking. On the other hand, faces are relatively simple objects and their properties been widely studied in medicine, anthropology, and computer graphics. This makes it easy to rigorously manipulate faces in research, through 3d modeling. Face research is both rigorous and impactful, which is why we focus on it.
